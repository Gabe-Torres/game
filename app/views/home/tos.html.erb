Access and use of the Service is subject to the following Terms and Conditions of Service (“Terms and Conditions”). By accessing or using any part of the Service, you represent that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions including any future modifications. DoMath may amend, update, or change these Terms and Conditions. If we do this, we will post a notice that we have made changes to these Terms and Conditions on the Websites for at least 7 days after the changes are posted and will indicate at the bottom of the Terms and Conditions the date these terms were last revised. Any revisions to these Terms and Conditions will become effective the earlier of (i) the end of such 7-day period or (ii) the first time you access or use the Service after such changes.

In no event will Duolingo be responsible for the actions or inactions of any third party payment processor, including, but not limited to, system downtime or payment service outages.</p>
    <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>All payments are nonrefundable. There are no refunds or credits for Virtual Items or partially used membership periods. However, Duolingo may grant refunds or credits on a case-by-case basis at our sole discretion. Duolingo’s grant of a refund or credit in one instance does not obligate Duolingo to provide a refund or credit in the future, under any circumstances. If you cancel your periodic subscription to a paid Duolingo service, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period.</p>
    <h2>Third-Party Links, Sites, and Services</h2>
    <p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites, advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by Duolingo. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services. If you access any third party website, service, or content from Duolingo, you understand that these Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy do not apply to your use of such sites. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Duolingo shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss arising from your use of any third-party website, service, or content.</p>
    <p>The Service may include advertisements, which may be targeted to the Content or information on the Service, or other information. The types and extent of advertising by Duolingo on the Service are subject to change. In consideration for Duolingo granting you access to and use of the Service, you agree that Duolingo and its third party providers and partners may place such advertising in connection with the display of content or information submitted by you or others.</p>
    <h2>NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES BY DUOLINGO</h2>
    <p>THE SERVICE, INCLUDING ALL IMAGES, AUDIO FILES AND OTHER CONTENT THEREIN, AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION, PROPERTY AND RIGHTS GRANTED OR PROVIDED TO YOU BY DUOLINGO ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN “AS IS” BASIS.

    <h2>LIMITATION ON TYPES OF DAMAGES/LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL DUOLINGO BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY CLAIMING THROUGH YOU (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY) FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE ACCESS OR USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE LOSS OF USE OF THE SERVICE, INACCURATE RESULTS, LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR DAMAGES STEMMING FROM LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE, THE COST OF RECOVERING ANY DATA, THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OR CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY DAMAGE TO COMPUTERS, SOFTWARE, MODEMS, TELEPHONES OR OTHER PROPERTY, EVEN IF DUOLINGO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, DUOLINGO’S LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY CLAIMING THROUGH YOU FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO DUOLINGO FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INITIAL ACTION GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY. THIS IS AN AGGREGATE LIMIT. THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM HEREUNDER WILL NOT INCREASE THIS LIMIT.</p>
    <p>You understand and agree that we have set our prices and entered into these Terms and Conditions with you in reliance upon the limitations of liability set forth in these Terms and Conditions, which allocate risk between us and form the basis of a bargain between the parties.</p>
