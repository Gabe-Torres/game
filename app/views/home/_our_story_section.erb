          <p>When our twins started kindergarten we bought a set expensive flash cards, but we had trouble keeping them organized and tracking progress. We turned to existing math apps, but they often looked awful and were riddled with ads and other distractions. We decided to build something for our kids and we think you'll like it as much as they do!</p>
          <p class="mt-8">The game starts with simple single digit addition facts and progresses incrementally through nearly 50 levels of addition, subtraction and multiplication. It's easy to see what problems your child is working on and which problems have already been mastered.</p>
          <p class="mt-8">We quiz your child on math facts at just the right level of difficulty. Problems are grouped into levels that are not so long that they'll be overwhelming.</p>
